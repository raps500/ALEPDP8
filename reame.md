ALE's PDP-8

My idea, as a side project to the more elaborate HP2100 project, is to recreate in HW, using TTL Logic, a PDP-8.
To investicate which architecture is more suited to my wish of using few chips a series of simulators are constructed, using VHDL. This enables the investigation of the different achitectures that I am considering, a hardwired and regitser file based, a microcoded one, and a behavioral mode that should provide a functional base line.
